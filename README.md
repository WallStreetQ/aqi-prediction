# Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction using Random Forest Regressor
This project implements a machine learning approach to predict Air Quality Index (AQI) values using a Random Forest Regressor. The model achieves exceptional performance with an R-squared score of 0.9890, demonstrating its ability to accurately forecast air quality conditions. Built on scikit-learn's random forest algorithm, the model shows consistent cross-validation results (mean CV RÂ² = 0.9876) and maintains robust generalization capabilities across different AQI ranges. While the model excels particularly well at predicting moderate to high pollution levels (AQI 150-200), it shows some variability in lower AQI ranges due to the bimodal distribution of the training data. The implementation includes comprehensive model evaluation with residual analysis and performance visualization, making it suitable for environmental monitoring applications, public health assessments, and air quality forecasting systems.
